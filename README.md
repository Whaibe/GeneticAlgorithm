# GeneticAlgorithm

This algorithm its an attempt to try and solve the traveling sales person problem.

It tryies to find the best and most efficient solution posible for someone to travel from point a(0,0) to point b(x,y).

This algorithm was implemented using p5.js a javascript a graphic library intended for simulation and desing.

It is particularly useful because we can actually see the points painted on a canvas so we can analize de solution.

The sketch to the link is below.

To run the program simply hit the big play button on the top left corner of the editor. If you want to get a new simulation just simply click play again.

To see the a solution fullscreen simply hit this link.
